There are two Python files,-

1. instaContent.py which if you run will first ask you for an Instagram user ID which must be publically accessible, then it'll download all the media that is present in the profile.
2. youTubeContent.py which if you run will first ask you for a link then it'll give various options as in whichever resolution the video can be downloaded, then you'll be asked to select an option of your choice and it'll be downloaded.
